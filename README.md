# For my capstone project in the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate, I created the **Little Lemon Website**, a fully responsive restaurant site built with **React.js** and modern front-end tools. I designed interactive UI components, set up dynamic routing, and focused on accessibility best practices. The project also involved implementing **form validation**, managing state with **useState** and **useEffect**, and optimizing performance to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience. ðŸš€
